This Django based fictional e-commerce application is the result of the last of five portfolio projects required for Code Institute.

FitnessForge is an online store dedicated to adventure seekers and fitness enthusiasts. Offering a unique selection of adventures, fitness try-outs, and tournaments. FitnessForge sells these experiences as vouchers, perfect for gifting or personal use. A standout feature is the 'Mystery Box,' which evaluates the total value of your purchase and adds complimentary mystery boxes to your order, enhancing the excitement and value. The website includes a user-friendly comment section on each product and a comprehensive FAQ section to assist shoppers. Registered users can log in to save their data, manage orders, access a personalized wishlist, and subscribe to a newsletter for the latest updates and offers. FitnessForge is designed to cater to both the seasoned athlete and the casual adventurer, providing an engaging and interactive shopping experience.


## UI/UX

### Site Goals
The Fitness Forge Website aims to provide a seamless shopping experience for fitness adventures. It enables users to register for fitness events easily and offers a platform where users can plan future fitness adventures for themselves and others. Fitness Forge aims to maintain and improve general health and physical fitness and to elevate the customers skills.

Users can select adventures and events from the categories Adventures, Sports Events and Special Offers

Once the user selects a specific adventure or event, he/she can adjust the quantity and personalize each adventure's attendees individually. The possibility to purchase adventures for multiple attendees makes the website to an ideal place to search for gifts and presents.

### Agile Methodology - User Stories
The realization of this project has been accomplished with the use of agile methodology. In order to visualize user stories and tasks as well as overall project progress, GitHub Projects has been used. GitHub Projects sees itself as “an adaptable, flexible tool for planning and tracking work on GitHub”.

The user stories were created including a speaking title, acceptance criteria and required tasks. They were also prioritized in order to give a visual indication on which user stories to focus on first, with P0 being a “Must Have”, P1 being a “Should Have” and P2 being a “Nice to Have”.

During the project the most commonly used views have been the “Backlog”, the “Priority board” and “My items”. Those have been adjusted to suit the need of a clear visibility of tasks and a good overview on the overall project progress. All others template views have been removed.

#### Backlog View

### 5 Planes of UX
- **Strategy Plane:** The project identified a clear need to create an e-commerce platform specifically for fitness enthusiasts. This insight guided the development process, ensuring the platform would attract and meet the demands of its target demographic.
- **Scope Plane:** The project’s functional requirements were clearly defined to include a dynamic product catalog that allows for regular updates and additions, comprehensive user account functionalities, a robust event registration system to handle various fitness activities, and interactive comment features enabling community engagement.
- **Structure Plane:** The design of the information architecture was a critical step, carefully planned to provide intuitive navigation and a logical flow of information. This framework supports users in finding and interacting with the content they need without unnecessary complexity or confusion.
- **Skeleton Plane:**  In designing the interface, attention was paid to the arrangement of interface elements to optimize the overall user experience. This included thoughtful placement of navigation bars, product listings, and interactive elements to ensure high usability and easy access for all users, particularly considering diverse accessibility needs.
- **Surface Plane:**  To finalize the platform's design, high-fidelity prototypes were crafted, focusing on a sleek, user-friendly interface that appeals to the modern consumer. These prototypes were instrumental in refining both the visual appeal and the functional layout, with a particular emphasis on ensuring a responsive, mobile-first design that performs well across various devices and screen sizes.

### Overall Design and Color Scheme
Based on the nature of the products and the target group, the overall design and the color scheme aim to reflect a modern and clean approach. The imposing, high quality product images are used to attract the target audience over visual input rather than an information overload.

The color scheme uses a monochromatic theme (different shades of grey) with vibrant accents (green, light blue) to invoke energy and action. It relates to the “outdoor nature” of the product and the target group. For action components, green, blue and light blue accents pick up on a modern approach and additionally attract a young and active target group.

The UI uses a monochromatic theme with vibrant accents to invoke energy and action, suitable for a fitness brand.Responsive design practices ensure usability across devices.

Typography involves a combination of Lato - the main font used - for readability and bold, motivational call-to-actions and thus supports the idea of a minimalistic, clean look and feel.

Responsive design practices ensure usability across devices.

### SEO Implementations

Effective Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is critical for improving visibility and ensuring that your content reaches its intended audience. Below are the key SEO strategies implemented within the HTML structure of the website.

#### Use of Semantic HTML Elements
- On both the homepage and product detail pages, we've strategically placed relevant keywords within headings and emphasized them using `<strong>` or `<em>` tags, carefully avoiding the practice of "keyword-stuffing."

#### Images
- Image SEO has been enhanced by enriching the `alt` attributes of `<img>` tags with relevant keywords, which are crucial for search engines. Additionally, image file names have been renamed to include these keywords to further optimize searchability.

#### Descriptive Meta Tags
- Within the `<head>` section of `base.html`, descriptive meta tags including `<meta name="description">` and `<meta name="keywords">` have been added. These tags provide search engines with a concise summary of the page's content and associated keywords.

#### XML Sitemap
- An XML sitemap has been created to list important URLs within the website, aiding search engines in understanding the site's structure. This sitemap ensures that all relevant pages are crawled and content is easily discovered. It was generated using an online sitemap generator and is located at the root level of the project.

#### Robots.txt
- The `robots.txt` file at the root of the project directory plays a vital role in managing search engine access. It allows search engines to crawl the website freely while specifying directories or files that should not be indexed. This not only helps in managing crawl traffic but also signals the website's quality, potentially improving search rankings.

Implementing these SEO practices is part of our ongoing effort to enhance the accessibility and visibility of our website, ensuring that our content reaches its target audience efficiently.

## Marketing

### Research of similar businesses

Main inspiration for the “Forge Fitness” business idea was Jochen Schweizer.

### Marketing Strategies

In order to obtain reasonable and effective marketing strategies, the following questions have been answered:

#### Who are my users?
- young to middle aged (aged 20-50)
- urban
- outdoor-savvy
- thrill-seekers
- with a focus on a healthy lifestyle.

#### Which online platforms including social media platforms would I find lots of my users on?
- My users can be found on platforms for individual content creation such as Facebook, Instagram and TikTok..

#### What do my users need? What are the goals of my business? Which marketing strategies would offer the best ways to meet those goals?
The objective of my business is to provide a seamless shopping experience for fitness enthusiasts and facilitate an easy way to register for fitness events. A main focus should be to support users' interests in maintaining and improving their general health and physical fitness, as well as elevating their skills. A platform where users can plan future fitness adventures for themselves and others will serve as an inspiration for new adventures, as well as a source for adventure-related gifts.

→ The marketing strategy will prioritize online channels to increase website traffic and enhance user engagement.

#### Would your business run sales or offer discounts? How do you think your users would most like to hear about these offers?
My users will receive “Mystery Boxes” as an reward for larger orders. There will be four possible “Mystery Box Tiers” depending on the volume of the order. At the moment users are notified in the FAQs. For a paid business it would be a valid option to inform users via posts on the Business' Facebook Page.

#### Would your business run sales or offer discounts? How do you think your users would most like to hear about these offers?
As for most businesses, free marketing options such as building a strong presence on social media platforms to connect with the target user group will be crucial in the beginning.

Complementing users can sign up for an optional newsletter in order to be informed about new events and adventures. MailChimp provides this functionality for free for up to 500 users and is therefore a suitable tool at an early stage of business development. The sign-up form is presented to customers after a successful check-out in order to increase the number of long-term subscribers. Like this, only users that retained the initial interest in the website's content will be on the mailing list, using the 500 free users most efficiently.

Additionally a dedicated business page on Facebook can be beneficial for promoting products and establishing customer interaction.

### Custom Models

This section describes the three custom models implemented in the platform, each designed to enhance user interactivity and provide essential features to both users and admins. The models are segmented into individual apps with their own URLs and views to maintain clarity and modularity.

#### 1. Comment Model

- **Purpose:** Allows users to leave comments on product detail pages, fostering a community-driven environment where users can share opinions and feedback.
- **Functionality:** Users can submit comments directly on a product’s detail page. Each comment is stored and displayed after submission, pending visibility settings or moderation if needed.

#### 2. FAQ Model

- **Purpose:** Provides a section for frequently asked questions where users can seek answers and submit their own questions.
- **Functionality:** Users can submit questions to the FAQ section. Submitted questions are not immediately visible; they require admin approval before being displayed publicly. This ensures that all information in the FAQ is accurate and relevant.

#### 3. Wishlist Model

- **Purpose:** Enables users to add products to a wishlist, allowing them to save their favorite items for later purchase or review.
- **Functionality:** Users can add products to their wishlist from the product details page. This wishlist is accessible via the user’s profile, where they can view, edit, or remove items as desired.

#### Architecture

Each of these models is housed in its own dedicated app within the Django project structure, including separate `models.py`, `views.py`, and `urls.py` files. This design approach:

- **Enhances Maintainability:** Isolating functionality into separate apps makes the codebase easier to manage and debug.
- **Improves Scalability:** As the platform grows, each app can be scaled or modified independently without affecting others.
- **Simplifies Testing:** Individual apps can be tested in isolation, ensuring that each component functions correctly before integration.

By using this modular architecture, the platform ensures that it remains both flexible and robust, catering to the evolving needs of its users while maintaining a clear organizational structure.

### CRUD Operations

This section outlines the Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) capabilities for both regular users and administrators within the platform.

#### Create

- **Users:**
  - Can create accounts to personalize their experience.
  - Can add products to their shopping cart.
  - Can register for events to participate in various activities.

- **Admins:**
  - Have the ability to create new products to keep the catalogue up-to-date.

#### Read

- **Users:**
  - Can browse all available products.
  - Can read comments from other users on products, gaining insights and feedback.

- **Admins:**
  - Can view all existing products, overseeing the complete range of offerings.

#### Update

- **Users:**
  - Can update their profile information to keep their personal data current.
  - Can modify their orders, making changes to their purchases as needed.

- **Admins:**
  - Can update product details to reflect changes such as pricing adjustments, descriptions, or stock levels.

#### Delete

- **Admins:**
  - Can remove outdated products to maintain a fresh and relevant product line.
  - Can delete FAQs that are no longer applicable or update them to reflect current information.
  - Can remove inappropriate or obsolete user comments to maintain a positive and useful community discourse.

Each of these operations supports the platform's functionality and enhances the user experience, ensuring both usability and administrative control.

## Testing

### Test Guide


### Code Refactoring

This project uses `flake8`, `black`, and `isort` for code linting, formatting, and import sorting to ensure code quality and consistency. The configuration for `black` has been adjusted to match the criteria of `flake8` by setting the line length to 79 characters.

### Linting, Formatting, and Import Sorting Tools

- **flake8**: A tool for checking the style guide enforcement, complexity, and bug detection.
- **black**: An uncompromising code formatter that reformats entire files in place.
- **isort**: A Python utility for sorting imports.

### Configuration

The configuration for `black` is specified in the `pyproject.toml` file:

```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 79
```

### Running Linting, Formatting, and Import Sorting

To run `flake8`, `black`, and `isort` on your codebase, use the following commands:

1. **flake8**:
    ```sh
    flake8 .
    ```

### Fixed Bugs

#### Incorrect Handling of Product IDs for Checkout

**Description:**
The checkout feature experiences a failure when processing orders due to the use of combined product IDs and hash values (e.g., "3_82215835d1f660ae5c8de3322c05b7cf") instead of purely numeric IDs. This issue occurs because the system tries to retrieve products using these combined IDs, which are not recognized by the database.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Add any product to the shopping cart and proceed to checkout.
2. During checkout, customize the product which results in a combined ID being generated (numeric ID and hash).
3. Attempt to complete the checkout process.

**Expected Behavior:**
The checkout process should successfully recognize and handle product IDs, even when they include customization hashes, and complete the order without errors.

**Actual Behavior:**
A `ValueError` is thrown stating that the field 'id' expected a number but got '3_82215835d1f660ae5c8de3322c05b7cf', causing the checkout process to fail.

**Possible Fix:**
The logic to extract and use product IDs during checkout processes should be corrected to split the combined ID and use only the numeric part when querying the database.

**Code Snippet:**
' ```python
for item_id, item_data in bag.items():
    product = get_object_or_404(Product, id=item_id) '


### Unfixed Bugs

#### Environment

- **Platform**: Django application running in Gitpod.
- **Functionality**: Using Gmail’s SMTP server for sending emails.

#### Problem

Attempts to send email (such as account signup confirmations) consistently fail due to a network connectivity issue. The specific error reported is:

Despite various configurations and settings adjustments, the issue persists.

#### Attempts Made

1. **SMTP Settings in `settings.py`**:
   - Configured to use Gmail's SMTP with appropriate user credentials and TLS settings.
   
2. **Testing Email Sending Locally**:
   - Attempts to send emails via Django shell resulted in the same network error.
   
3. **Network Tools**:
   - Tried using `telnet` and `nc` to check connectivity, but faced tool availability issues in Gitpod.
   
4. **Reviewing and Modifying Django Configuration**:
   - Checked for correct environment variables and configurations.

#### Hypothesis for the Bug

Given the persistent network error and the cloud development environment (Gitpod), the issue likely lies in network restrictions or SMTP traffic being blocked by the hosting environment. Gitpod might have strict network policies that prevent SMTP connections to external servers like Gmail.

## Deployment and Configuration

### Deployment on Heroku
This project is deployed on Heroku, utilizing the following steps and tools:

1. **Installation of Necessary Libraries**:
   - Install psycopg2 and dj_database_url for PostgreSQL connectivity:
     ```bash
     pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2
     ```
   - Install Gunicorn, the server for running Django on Heroku:
     ```bash
     pip3 install django gunicorn
     ```

2. **Requirements.txt**:
   - Generate the `requirements.txt` file to list all necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
     ```
   - Commit and push these changes to GitHub.

3. **Sensitive Information**:
   - Ensure all sensitive credentials are stored in an `env.py` file and excluded from Git tracking by including this file in `.gitignore`.
   - Set environment variables in `env.py`:
     ```python
     import os
     os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "<copied_database_url>"
     os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your_secret_key"
     ```

## Repository Management

This section guides you through the processes of forking, cloning, and downloading the repository from GitHub.

### Forking a Repository
Forking a repository allows you to create a personal copy of another project on GitHub without affecting the original. Here’s how to fork a repository:

1. **Navigate** to the repository on GitHub.
2. **Locate** the “Fork” button in the top-right corner of the page and click it.
3. **Adjust** the name of the fork and add a description if necessary.
4. **Choose** which branches you want to copy (main branch or all branches).
5. **Click** "Create a Fork". The new repository will now appear in your GitHub account and can be cloned or modified as needed.

### Cloning a Repository
Cloning a repository creates a local copy on your machine, linked to the original repository. Changes pushed from this clone can affect the original repository if you have the necessary permissions.

1. **Navigate** to the repository on GitHub.
2. **Locate** the “Code” drop-down button above the file list.
3. **Select** your preferred method for copying the repository URL (HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI).
4. **Open** Git Bash or your preferred terminal and navigate to the desired directory where you want the repository to be cloned.
5. **Type** `git clone`, followed by the copied URL.
6. **Press** “Enter” to create the local clone.

### Downloading a Repository as a ZIP
Downloading a repository as a ZIP file is useful for obtaining a snapshot of the project to run locally without git tracking.

1. **Navigate** to the repository on GitHub.
2. **Locate** the “Code” drop-down button above the file list.
3. **Select** “Download ZIP”.
4. **Extract** the ZIP file in your local environment to begin working with the files.

Each method serves different purposes—forking for personal modifications without affecting the original, cloning for direct contributions back to the original repository, and downloading for quick access or testing without version control.
